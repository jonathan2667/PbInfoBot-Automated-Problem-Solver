# PBInfoBot: Automated Problem Solver ðŸ¤–

## Introduction
PBInfoBot is a powerful Python script designed to automate problem-solving tasks on the "pbinfo.ro" website. Leveraging the Selenium and PyAutoGUI libraries, this bot streamlines the process of fetching official solutions for a wide range of problems.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Problem Resolution:** Automatically retrieves official solutions for problems on "pbinfo.ro".
- **Dual-Account Authentication:** Utilizes a designated account to access the platform securely.
- **Smart Error Handling:** Detects and handles invalid or missing problems gracefully.
- **Minimal Human Intervention:** Runs autonomously, minimizing the need for manual oversight.

## How it Works
1. The script logs in to the "pbinfo.ro" website using predefined credentials.
2. It iterates through a range of problem IDs, fetching official solutions if available.
3. If a problem is invalid or missing, the bot gracefully handles the situation by providing a message indicating the issue.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Selenium
- PyAutoGUI
- WebDriver (for Firefox)

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of additional error handling mechanisms.
- Implementation of user feedback and reporting features.
- Optimization for performance and reliability.

## Usage
1. Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed.
2. Run the script using a compatible Python interpreter.

## Note
While functional, the script may require periodic updates to maintain compatibility with website changes.

Happy problem-solving! ðŸš€
